# Preface

The book is more breadth (introductory and general knowledge) than depth for any particular typical statistical technique in the social and behavioral sciences.

> "Most students dislike mathematics that are unclear, poorly communicated, or otherwise purposely cryptic."

Read the inventor's of the method itself if you want to understand the method more clearly than those after.

## Hypothesis Testing and Decision Making: Type I and II Errors

Making too rigid decision on using 0.10 or 0.05 as the threshold in defining statistical significance for every level and every subject of research is not wise. Though it is not wrong statistically, but it is not feasible to compensate the real impact.

Also, they too often ignore Type II error.

> For instance, it is my belief that if a student has a solid understanding of what analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression actually are beyond memorization and formula manipulation, this puts the student in an ideal position to extend that knowledge to virtually any statistical model he or she chooses to master in the future.

# Preliminary Considerations

The end goal of applied statistics is to use statistical modeling in the context of science exploration and discovery.

## 1.1 The Philosophical Bases of Knowledge: Rationalistic Versus Empiricist Pursuits

There are two spectrums of gaining knowledge:

1. Rationalist: based on reasoning, and the object itself can be abstract
2. Empiricist: based on experience - objective reality, and the object is tangible in the real worlds

> Science should be possess a healthy blend of both perspectives.
